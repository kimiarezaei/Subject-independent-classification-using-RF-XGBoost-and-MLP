# Classification using XGBoost, Random Forest and Multilayer peceptron
Seizure classification is done using XGBoost, Random Forest(RF) and Multilayer peceptron (MP), for the purpose of comparison.

Inputs are the heart rate features.

The classification is conducted patient independent and the models are tuned using randomized grid search to overcome overfeating.

The result of each classifier is evaluated using different measures and saved.
