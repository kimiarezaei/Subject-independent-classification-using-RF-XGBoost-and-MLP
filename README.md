# Classification using XGBoost, Random Forest and Multilayer peceptron
- Seizure classification is done using XGBoost, Random Forest(RF) and Multilayer peceptron (MP), for the purpose of comparison.

- Inputs are the heart rate features.I provided the feature extraction code in (https://github.com/kimiarezaei/Heart-Rate-features)
